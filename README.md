# README for CS229 Spring 2022 Project

Contributors: Daniel Huang, Ruth-Ann Armstrong, Radhika Kapoor

## Setup for team members

1. Git clone repo from github
2. Download dataset from google drive
3. Unpack the files into ../dataset
4. Delete any remaining .zip files containing the dataset

If things are set up correctly, there the dataset should not be included in `git status`.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT UPLOAD ANY PART OF THE DATASET TO THIS REPO, AS THIS IS A PUBLIC REPO! DOUBLE CHECK EVERY TIME!

## TODO list

<!-- 1. [ ] dfsdf
2. [x] sdfsdf -->
